# EPSEL-LEVEL-SYSTEM
ESPELeagueLevels is a level system for you'r server.
Its as been made by a french developper ( well ... its me lel ) so the plugin will be in french, you are free to make an english version but i will not support it for the next update, you will have to update it manually.



=====================================================================

Commands :

/level : Thats will show you'r level and exp in the chat

======================================================================

How do it work ?

When you play on the server it do give you exp, for be more presise its when you do mouvement, if you walk, turn around, alla mouvement give you exp   

For now only that do give you exp, soon i will add the fact that it give you exp by killing player, and losing exp if you die.


Also there is a Préstige system ! When you are level 100, you return level 1 but with 1 prestige, that mean in the chat you will have a little [P.1] mean you are préstige 1 !



I hope you did understand what i try to explain, its pretty hard for me to explain in english, again i am french english is not my main language.
